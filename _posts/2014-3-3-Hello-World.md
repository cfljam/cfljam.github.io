I like using computers to get genetics done, and trying to explain how.
I'm inspired by modern, lightweight expressive technologies like Markdown.

My first taste of computing was when my father let me play at writing interpreted code in [FOCAL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOCAL_(programming_language)) on a Digital PDP-8

but now I like Virtual Machines and modern interpreted languages like R and python

This is where I will share my explorations and inspirations.
