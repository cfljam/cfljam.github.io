## Gisting iPython Notebooks

Github provides an amazing environment for developing code and data resources in a social environment but the learing curve is rather steep.
By contrast, [Github Gist](gist.github.com) provides a much simpler versioned storage space for simple files **AND** it allows *secret* Gists which have an unguessable hash ID hidden from search engines. Sooo...

1. it provides a place to store modest amounts of working code or data, hidden from the web
2. ..but you can share the link to it how **YOU** choose

I have made [a small iPython Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/cfljam/a44c48e20a78e704ba1f), that shows how it was saved and updated to Gist.github.com as a secret gist.

This is my standard workflow for storing electronic labbook notes now (though key work may stay inside private repos)## A New Post
