## Gisting iPython Notebooks

Github provides an amazing environment for developing code and data resources in a social environment but the learing curve is rather steep.
By contrast, [Github Gist](gist.github.com) provides a much simpler versioned storage space for simple files **AND** it allows *secret* Gists which have an unguessable hash ID hidden from search engines. Sooo...

1. it provides a place to store modest amounts of working code or data, hidden from the web
2. ..but you can share the link to it how **YOU** choose

I have made [a small iPython Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/cfljam/a44c48e20a78e704ba1f), that shows how it was saved and updated to Gist.github.com as a secret gist.

This is now my standard workflow for storing electronic labbook notes now (though key work may stay inside private repos). It is easy to tag and search notebooks using the GistBox web app https://app.gistboxapp.com/.
