## Using R in Jupyter Notebooks

When [Github enabled rendering of Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/blog/1995-github-jupyter-notebooks-3) recently they provided a compelling reason for R users try out the data document authoring power that is [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). One trouble with Jupyter is that, compared to R environments like the  awesome [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/)  installation and configration burden for the [R2py cell magics](http://rpy.sourceforge.net/rpy2.html) or [R kernels] is quite a lot greater. [This nice blog post](http://www.michaelpacer.com/maths/r-kernel-for-ipython-notebook) describes how to install the R kernel on OSX.
