As part of the 2014 [MAPNET Workshop](http://www.agresearch.co.nz/news/events/Pages/MAPNET.aspx) I will present a small some examples of using iPython Notebooks to complement demonstrations of the [selection pipeline](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4144660/) developed by VISG colleagues.
The aim of the workshop will be to demonstrate the possibilities and power of *learning, developing and sharing*  analyses of genetics data in the [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) ecosystem. 

### Topics to be demonstrated

- tabular data handling with [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html)
- plotting with matplotib and ggplot2
- saving and sharing notebooks through [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/)
