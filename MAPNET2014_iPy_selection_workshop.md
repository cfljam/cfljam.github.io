## Executable Explanations at MAPNET

### MAPNET Selections Sweeps and iPython Workshop Wednesday 22 October 2014 

As part of the 2014 [MAPNET Workshop](http://www.agresearch.co.nz/news/events/Pages/MAPNET.aspx) I will present a small some examples of using iPython Notebooks to complement demonstrations of the [selection pipeline](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4144660/) developed by VISG colleagues.
The aim of the workshop will be to demonstrate the possibilities and power of *learning, developing and sharing*  analyses of genetics data in the [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) ecosystem. 

### Topics to be demonstrated

- use of Unix Shell, Python and R cell magics 
- Manipulation of vcf ([Variant Call Format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_Call_Format)) data 
- interval operations with [BedTools](http://bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
- tabular data handling with [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html)
- plotting with matplotib and ggplot2
- saving and sharing notebooks through [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) 

### Workshop Software and Pre-Requisites 

Participants may just choose to look and learn and ask questions, but can also pre-install software to allow them to run the examples. Here's how:
